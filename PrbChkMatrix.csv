# This file is generates the sequences to use switching matrixes
# Currently, up to eight Inputs are available and can be addressed with "A" to "H"
# A line starting with "!" determines the setup of outputs. Either normal or Bits is possible:
# i.e.: "!1-6.BM: Normal; 7-24: Bit"
#       "!Normal:1.BM,2,3,4,5,6; Bit: 7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24"
# All following inputs must follow the above layout, if an output is not defined it will be ignored:
# Each line must define the number of normal inputs plus the high and low input for the bit input at the end
# For the example above, 8 inputs must be defined, 6 normal and high/low
# A line starting with "$" changes the inputs to "BM" or "MB" meaning Break-Make or Make-Break:
# i.e. "$ BM, BM, MB, BM" 
# a maximum of 8 inputs can be defined, all non defined inputs are automatically Break-Make
# If this nomenclausure is not used, Break-Make is used, Please read up on BM and MB before using it.#
